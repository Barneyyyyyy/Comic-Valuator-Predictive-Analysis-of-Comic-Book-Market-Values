# Comic Valuator: Predictive Analysis of Comic Book Market Values

## Project Overview
"Comic Valuator" is a machine learning project aimed at analyzing historical data from comic book issues to predict future market values. By leveraging a rich dataset of comic book characteristics and sales figures, this project seeks to identify patterns and trends that influence the appreciation in the value of comic books over time.

## Objective
The primary goal is to forecast the potential future value of comic books, helping collectors, investors, and enthusiasts make informed decisions. This is achieved by predicting the 'current_value' of comic books based on various features such as issue number, cover date, initial cover price, rarity, and character appearances.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following key columns:
- `title`: The series title.
- `issue`: Issue number within the series.
- `cover_date`: Release date of the issue.
- `cover_price`: Original sale price.
- `current_value`: The highest price the issue was ever sold.
- `searched`: Frequency the issue was searched in the database.
- `owned`: Number of users who logged the issue as owned.
- `rating`: Average user rating.
- `est_print_run`: Estimated print run size.
- `characters`: Characters appearing in the issue.
- `years`: The year span the title was published.
- `pub_name`: The name of the publisher.
- `pub_issues_total`: Total number of issues released by the publisher.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and explore the data to understand the distribution and relationships.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that could help predict the comic book value.
- **Model Development**: Build and train machine learning models suitable for regression tasks.
- **Model Evaluation and Selection**: Use cross-validation and metrics like MAE and RMSE to evaluate model performance.
- **Prediction**: Predict the future value of comic books based on the trained model.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch (depending on model complexity)
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Model Deployment**: Flask/Django (for web application), Docker (for containerization)

## Usage
Instructions on how to set up the environment, train the model, and perform predictions will be included in detailed documentation within the project repository.
